# employee-analytics

Employee-analytics is a demo project that allows developers to simulate working with a large amount of records in a database. The database has 500k records currently, and it was done by utilizing a python script using the faker python library to generate realistic names, emails, salaries, phone numbers, and other data. The current objective is to conduct analysis on the 500k records, and then build out functionality that our fictional company would find important.
